To count the total amount of orders first I'm trying to get the file context and iterate trough every element increasing the
right field in the $total array. It's good to notice that there is just one iteration trought each element which is very effective
and gives us time complexity of O(n)

For this particular example I found using IF statements more practical than switch, as it's easier to read nested conditions.

To count free orders I'm using equal comparison operator (==) and taking advantage that php is automatically casting the string
to a float number. That default behaviour can be disabled, and if it will be then I should cast all the strings to floats.

Then I'm checking if the order was made in GBP. Just in case someone put the currency manually I first cast the string to upper case
as a good practice. Inside this condition I'm increasing number of orders and sum in total array accordingly, and then checking if
the price was larger than 100, again taking advantage of php string to number automatical casting.

In the last IF statement I'm checking if the order shipping address is in essex, converting the incomming string to lower case,
for the same reason as with the currency, and in the nested condition I'm checking for the currency.

If the file will fail to load the Exeption will be thrown and suspend the script execution, that exception should be properly handled.

If I have more time I will definitelly make it a class, f.e. OrdersFileReader, load the file in the constructor and use
different methods for logic and outputting the message and make $total array as an object property.
