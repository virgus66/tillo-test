# PHP Developer Task 2018

Using the provided "orders.json" file, please complete the following tasks.

Please download/clone this repository and when you're complete, send the results back in a zip file.

1. In written English, briefly describe how you would:
  - count the total number of orders
  - count the number of orders that were free
  - count the number of orders placed in "GBP"
  - sum the orders placed in "GBP"
  - sum the orders placed in "GBP" that were over "£100"
  - count the number of orders that shipped to the county "Essex"
  - sum the orders that were shipped to the county "Essex" that were paid for in "GBP"

2. Using PHP now complete the above tasks.
  - We would like the output to be viewable in the browser or from the command line in a format similar to:
  ```
  Total number of orders: XXX
  Number of orders that were free: XXX
  Number of orders placed in GBP: XXX
  Sum of orders placed in GBP: XXX
  Sum of orders over £100 placed in GBP: XXX
  Number of orders shipped to Essex: XXX
  Sum of orders placed in GBP that were shipped to Essex: XXX
  ```
  - We've included a "composer.json" file should you choose to pull in some external libraries to help you but this is optional.
  - How you complete the tasks is up to you.
  - It shouldn't take you more than an hour to complete however if you're not complete it doesn't mean you have failed the test - share your code as it is good to understand your approach/style.
