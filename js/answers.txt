js_test_1

when assigning event listeners to the buttons in the for loop there was a problem that we ended up with three listeners that were
indicating to the element with index 3, which doesn't exist in the array. The loop goes 3 times, and the fourth time it fails, 
but the btnNum variable remains to be 3 and all listeners are trying to access it. By changing var to let when initialise the variable
we give it a scope which is different for each iteration.
Although the right approach will be to create just one listener which will listen for any button to be clicked and the prize id should be
kept in separate attribute, like prize-id=0 and this parameter should be read and accessed. That will improve performance when we have
multiple buttons on the website, and it's easier to unregister it while using any reactive framework and we are umounting component.

I'm not sure if this is the approach you expected. I'm happy to discuss it further.

I've focused on functionality and to finish all tasks rather than styles.
